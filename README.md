# [ mentalmetrics.xyz ]( https://mentalmetrics.xyz/ "Website") #### Helping you take life one day at a time!

### About:

Mental Metrics is a project that is being worked on for the Uiowa Hackathon, the goal is to help people take their depression one day at a time, practice self care, and be prepared to face a possibly challenging day.

Due to the time limitations of only 36 hours, we had to narrow our list down from the many things we wanted to do and monitor to warn the user about to just a couple of things that were deemed important. The main one being the day's weather. Not only people with Seasonal Affective Dissorder, but people with anxiety and depression in general see a drop in their moods when it's cold, raining, or overcast.  We monitor for that and remind people to take steps to practice self care and ensure that they stay healthy.

### Plans:

We have plans to expand this out into a fully functioning application that, we hope, will be able to assist a lot of people through these dark times and give them the tools they need to practice self care and self love even when it is hardest.

We plan to expand the application out, and expand the scope of the website, moving to a new host that will allow for a dedicated back end, and moving from swift to react native so that we have more control over the final look and performance.

We also plan to start allowing users to track behavioral pattern along with their mood, such as exercise, eating patterns, sleep, and the various behaviors that go into self care and contribute to living a better and happier life.
